# Project Brief: anchorcast

## Project Type
Frontend Web Application (Prototype/Dashboard)

## Project Goals (Golden Context)
To build a high-fidelity, responsive, and visually polished dashboard for a boat-broker social media autoposter. The primary objectives are to implement a Glassmorphism/Bento Grid UI using Next.js 14 App Router, manage state locally with dummy data without external API calls, and establish a scalable component structure that can be easily connected to a backend in future iterations.

## Complexity
Moderate. While the logic is simplified by removing backend integration and external state management, the project requires a high level of attention to detail in CSS architecture (custom glass utilities), responsive grid layouts (Bento design), and strict adherence to UI/UX specifications (animations, breakpoints, and component modularity).

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Icons**: Heroicons v2
- **Font**: Inter (Next/font)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState)
- **Utilities**: clsx, tailwind-merge
