    "Initialize Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration, including `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.js`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, and the basic `app/` directory (root layout and page).",
    "Implement the Data Layer by creating `app/lib/types.ts` to define interfaces (User, Stats, Boat, Post, Template, Social) and `app/lib/dummy.ts` to populate these interfaces with static mock data.",
    "Implement Phase 3: Core UI Components. Create `app/styles/glass.css` for utility classes, `app/components/bento/GlassPane.tsx` for the primary wrapper, and `app/components/ui/Button.tsx`, `app/components/ui/Toggle.tsx`, and `app/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx` for interactive primitives.",
    "Implement the remaining Phase 3 components: `app/components/bento/StatCard.tsx` and `app/components/bento/QuickAction.tsx`. These components should utilize the `GlassPane` wrapper and `Button` component to display statistics (with icons, labels, and trend indicators) and primary action buttons (e.g., \"Sync Now\", \"Add Boat\") respectively.",
    "Refactor `app/layout.tsx` to comply with Next.js 14 App Router standards (including Inter font and metadata) and create the `app/components/layout/PageShell.tsx` component. Additionally, implement the `Nav`, `MobileDrawer`, and `UserDropdown` components within the layout directory to establish the main application shell.",
    "Implement Phase 5: Dashboard Page. Create `app/page.tsx` with a responsive 12-column Bento grid layout. Create `app/components/bento/UpcomingPosts.tsx` (a calendar/schedule widget) and `app/components/bento/RecentLogs.tsx` (an activity log table). Integrate these with the existing `StatCard` and `QuickAction` components, importing data from `app/lib/dummy.ts`. Ensure the layout collapses to a single column on mobile.",
    "Implement the Boats Catalogue feature page. Create the directory `app/boats/page.tsx` and the sub-components `app/components/boats/BoatGridCard.tsx` and `app/components/boats/BoatTableRow.tsx`. Implement local state for switching between Grid and Table views and add a search bar to filter the boat list using the dummy data.",
    "[FAILED] Implement the Posts page (`/posts`). Create `app/posts/page.tsx` with tab switching logic to filter between 'published' and 'failed' posts. Build the required sub-components: `app/components/posts/PostPreview.tsx` (to display post details), `app/components/posts/PostStatusBadge.tsx` (to visually indicate status), and `app/components/posts/PublishRetry.tsx` (to simulate retrying failed posts). Populate the view using data from `app/lib/dummy.ts` and ensure the design follows the Glassmorphism aesthetic.",
    "Implement the Posts Management page (`/posts`). This involves creating `app/posts/page.tsx` to manage the list of posts and the `retryingIds` state. Create the supporting components: `app/components/posts/PostStatusBadge.tsx` (for visual status), `app/components/posts/PublishRetry.tsx` (handling the retry action and loading state), and `app/components/posts/PostPreview.tsx` (assembling the post card). Ensure strict TypeScript interfaces: `posts/page.tsx` passes `post`, `boatTitle`, `isRetrying`, and `onRetry` to `PostPreview`, which in turn passes `post`, `isRetrying`, and `onRetry` to `PublishRetry`. Use standard `@heroicons/react` imports directly to avoid missing file errors.",
    "Implement Phase 6.3: Templates page. Create `app/templates/page.tsx` to manage the template selection state. Build `app/components/templates/TemplateEditor.tsx` with a text area for message composition and dynamic placeholder helpers. Build `app/components/templates/HashtagChips.tsx` to handle adding and removing hashtag tags visually. Ensure all components adhere to the Glassmorphism aesthetic."
